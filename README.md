The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) ecosystems has introduced a vast attack surface, making network security a top priority. With an increasing number of cyber threats targeting these environments, the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is more critical than ever.

To support this, Ferrag *et al.* introduced the **Edge-IIoTset**, a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking centralized and federated learning-based IDS. This project utilizes the DNN-EdgeIIoT subset to classify network traffic and detect cyber-attacks using both traditional machine learning and deep learning models.

Due to computational limitations, the project was divided across two notebooks: one for **data preprocessing** and the other for **modeling** and **evaluation**.
